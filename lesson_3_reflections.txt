1.  When would you want to create a remote depository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When you wanted one person to be able to work on certain files from different
machines, or when several people would
be working on one repository.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

Because you might be working on changes locally that could be overwritten if Git was
automatically pulling from GitHub on an
arbitrary timetable.

3.  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are copies in GitHub where a repository in one user's account is copied to
another user's account; a clone is a copy of a remote repository using https:// onto
your local machine; a branch is a working copy of the master branch on your local
machine for the purpose of testing new code, etc.

4.  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows one to work off-line if necessary; and to easily compare the local master
with state of the remote master.
