1.  When would you want to create a remote depository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you wanted one person to be able to work on certain files from different machines, or when several people would
be working on one repository.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

Because you might be working on changes locally that could be overwritten if Git was automatically pulling from GitHub on an
arbitrary timetable.
