1.  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory to track future commits.  git init is neccessary to create the repository structure that will enable the git commands to be used on the files in the directory.

2.  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are placed, with changes, prior to being committed.  Files in the staging area can't be edited; but they can be deleted from the staging, or newly updated files from the working area can be put into the staging area.
